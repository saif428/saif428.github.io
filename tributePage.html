          <blockquote><p class="text-center" style="font-size:14px">"For every high school kid out there or college player, there is greatness in being the kind of teammate who truly wants to be part of a team. Everyone wants to be the reason they winning or losing. Every single one of us wants to be that person. But there are special moments that come from a shared commitment to play a role, while doing it together. That's what you will remember. Not your stats or your prestige, but the relationships and the achievement that you created through a group. It's hard to do, but there's great joy in that." </p><p id="quoteStyle" class="text-center">-Tony Romo</p></blockquote>
